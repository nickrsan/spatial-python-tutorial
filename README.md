# Spatial Python Tutorial

An introduction to spatial data and processing spatial information using Python.

## Audience
This tutorial is designed to be used by people who are already comfortable with databases, programming, and/or data
science. It was developed as a tutorial for the US Research Software Engineer's Conference 2023 and assumes
a similar skill level. Concepts related to data types, data querying, and programming in general are not
explained. But it assumes no familiary with spatial information.

## Format
This notebook is designed to be used self-contained, or instructor-led. If working through this without
an instructor, make sure to read *all* the text - the comments are critical to explaining and understanding
not just the code, but spatial data in general.

## Using the Tutorial
This tutorial runs in the cloud on MyBinder.org - no setup is required on your computer to get started.
MyBinder will usually load the notebook quickly - in a minute or two, but can take some time
(as long as an hour) if it has been a long time since the notebook was last run.
