    "# Goals and Approach\n",
    "This tutorial assumes familiarity with tabular data, table joins, and general data science and data structures that research software engineers will, by and large, understand. It will focus on the addition of spatial capabilities to that toolset and intentionally chooses geopandas and related libraries for data processing so as to act as a layer on top of other tools for working with data rather than a whole new suite of concepts. It won't explain concepts like tabular subsets (often called selections in GUI-based GIS tools) in depth, because these are common to data science approaches, but it will explain new capabilities provided by spatial data."

    "## How is Spatial Data Different?\n",
    "For most experienced analysts of tabular and image data, spatial data will be familiar, but it provides a few conceptual differences:\n",
    "1. Tabular fields with spatial information can be connected to other tables by their spatial information leading to new kinds of joins based not on keys, but on *location*, with varied criteria for matching. This is a deeply powerful capability leading to a whole new class of questions and answers\n",
    "2. Image data - not just visible light images, but also gridded datasets - have geographic referencing allowing them to be overlaid in space with other image or tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spatial Data Questions\n",
    "* **What exists** at a certain location?\n",
    "* **Where** (or when) are certain conditions satisfied?\n",
    "* **What has changed** in a place over time?\n",
    "* What **spatial patterns** exist?\n",
    "* **What if** this condition occurred at this place? (modeling, hypothesis testing)\n",
    "* **Where** do variables interact?\n",
    "* We can try to answer questions of “why” and “how” too, but they require reformulating the question\n"

    "* **GDAL**: Geospatial Data Abstraction Library - software underlying most of the spatial operations we'll do - you usually don't need to call it directly, but you usually *do* need it installed\n",

    "* **geopandas**: A package that extends Pandas dataframes so that they also have spatial data support (including spatial operations) - crossing data science approaches with spatial information!\n",

    "Anaconda/conda environments are often a solution, but I've seen `geopandas` break conda environments (entirely) as often as I've successfully installed it, so I recommend a different approach.
